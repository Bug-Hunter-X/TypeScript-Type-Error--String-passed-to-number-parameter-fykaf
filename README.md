# TypeScript Type Error Example

This repository demonstrates a simple yet common type error in TypeScript where a string is passed as an argument to a function that expects a number.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix this by adding type guards or using type assertions.
